DATA OVERVIEW

The data I required was easily found over wikipedia. To help understand the address system of the tricity I took help
from my Polish friends and finally arrived at the conclusion that its best to segment the model based on the different 
districts. The names of the districts were taken from wikipedia and I used the geopy library to get the coordinates.
Since the library may cause problems while using,the data has been downloaded as a csv file called final_data.csv.
